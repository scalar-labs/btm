BTM - Bitronix's JTA transaction manager
========================================
version 1.3-beta1, April 5, 2008

 * BTM-4   Implement incremental recovery
 * BTM-7   Resource password is not decrypted when using the API
 * BTM-8   Durable subscribers cannot participate in XA
 * BTM-9   BitronixTransactionManager JNDI reference throws NPE on toString()
 * BTM-10  Race condition in connection pools when lazily initialized
 * BTM-11  Implement an embedded JNDI provider that allows to retrieve the TM and configured resources in a more standard way
 * BTM-12  add maven support
 * BTM-13  Implement ordering of XAResource during 2PC execution
 * Shutdown hook is not registered anymore when the TM starts up. It is now mandatory to shut it down manually.
 * Dropped all deprecated classes and methods.
 * Fixed incorrect transaction manager startup while using pools when BTM is not started.
 * Moved CryptoEngine to bitronix.tm.utils, kept bitronix.tm.internal.CryptoEngine but deprecated it.
 * Resource Loader cannot bind to JNDI anymore (no more needed, see: BTM-11), this obsoletes bitronix.tm.resource.bind property.
 * Transaction timeout logic has been rationalized, this obsoletes bitronix.tm.timer.transactionRetryInterval property.

Important notes
---------------
 Incremental recovery required a change in the Disk Journal's log format. Compatibility with older format (1.2 and below)
 has been maintained but journals created by BTM 1.3 cannot be read by older versions.
