* Fixed race condition in JMS resource wrapper.
* Changed JTA and JMS 1.1 spec files from Sun for the ones coming from Apache as the license is more permissive.
* Refactored 2PC logic to make it possible to use any kind of execution mechanism (synchronous, JDK 1.5+ concurrent package, ...).
* Hardened transaction log files integrity checks and added bitronix.tm.journal.disk.skipCorruptedLogs configuration property to allow the recovery process to skip corrupted log entries.
* Transaction log files are now locked to avoid unexpected collisions.
* JndiXAConnectionFactory now allows security Principal and Credentials to be provided.
* Added resource parameter allowLocalTransactions to disallow non-explicit mixing of xa and non-xa transactions.
